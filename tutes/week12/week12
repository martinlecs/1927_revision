1. While a random graph walk or DFS can potentially find the shortest
path (least number of edges), it is not guaranteed each time. BFS
explores the graph by spreading out a network from the source. Whenever
it reaches the destination, that must be the shortest path (least
edges).

2. (a) Trace through the final arrays and make sure that things match
up.

3. min depth =  ceil(log2n)

4. (b)

5.

9. Revise red-black trees until I can predict how to build them
