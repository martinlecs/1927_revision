1. A connected graph is a graph where a vertex can be reached from any
other vertex in the graph. A complete graph is where every vertex is
connected to each other. A connected graph is a subgraph of a complete
graph.

2. 

Hamilton path: Path that contains each vertex exactly once
Euler Path: Path that contains each edge exactly once.
Circuit/Tour: where there first vertex is the same as the last vertex.


Euler Path: Exactly 2 vertices with odd degree
Euler Circuit: Vertices all have even degree

G1: There is a hamilton and euler path from 0-1-2
G2: There are two hamilton paths (0-1-2 and 2-1-0). There is one Euler
circuit (0-1-2-0)
G3: No hamilton paths/tours. No euler path/tours
G4: Hamilton paths exist (e.g. 0-3-2-1 or 1-2-3-0). Hamilton circuit
also exists. No euler path

a) Bridge: an edge in which its removable causes the increase of
components (disconnected parts).
b) cc{} does not change. Removing d does not cause an increase in the
number of componentes
c) removing bridge b causes another component to form (2)

so vertices 2-6-8 will be considered its own component so
a[]= {0,0,2,1,1,1,2,0,2,1}

5. see /code/
Rather than checking that every vertex is even. Its easier to check if
one of the vertices is odd which invalidates the exisitence of a Euler
path ie. prove that there isnt an euler path by showing that one of its
vertices is odd which is proof by contradiction.
